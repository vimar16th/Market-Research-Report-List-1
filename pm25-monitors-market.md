<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PM2.5 Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TEOM Monitor</li><li>Beta Attenuation Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PM2.5 monitors are devices used to measure fine particulate matter in the air. Two common types are TEOM monitors and Beta Attenuation monitors. TEOM monitors, or Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance monitors, measure the mass of particles collected on a filter. Beta Attenuation monitors use beta radiation to measure the particle concentration. Both types provide accurate and reliable data on PM2.5 levels, allowing governments, organizations, and individuals to monitor air quality and take necessary actions to reduce pollution and protect public health.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Foaming Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic Foaming Agent</li><li>Organic Foaming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rubber foaming agents are substances that are used to produce cellular structures in rubber materials. Inorganic foaming agents are typically based on chemicals like azodicarbonamide and nitrogen-based compounds. They release gases as they decompose during the vulcanization process, resulting in the formation of foam. Organic foaming agents, on the other hand, are derived from natural or synthetic substances like fatty acids or esters, and they work by reducing the surface tension of rubber, allowing gases to be trapped and forming foam. Both types of foaming agents contribute to the production of lightweight and flexible rubber products.</p></p>

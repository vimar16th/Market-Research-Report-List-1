<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-lock Brake (ABS) Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sensor</li><li>Passive Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti-lock Brake (ABS) Sensors market consists of two types: Active Sensor and Passive Sensor. Active Sensors are capable of generating electric signals on their own without any external power source. They can detect wheel rotation and send signals to the ABS control module. On the other hand, Passive Sensors rely on an external power source, such as the vehicle's battery. They work by detecting interruptions in the magnetic field when the wheel rotates and transmit the information to the ABS control module. Both types are crucial in ensuring the effective functioning of ABS systems in vehicles.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agrotextiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Woven</li><li>Knitted</li><li>Nonwoven</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Agrotextiles market is categorized into four main types based on the manufacturing technique used: woven, knitted, nonwoven, and others. Woven agrotextiles are created by weaving fabric threads together, providing durability and strength. Knitted agrotextiles are made by interlocking loops of yarn, offering flexibility and stretchability. Nonwoven agrotextiles are produced by entangling fibers together rather than weaving or knitting, resulting in a porous and permeable fabric. The "others" category includes agrotextiles made using unique techniques or materials that do not fit into the previous three types.</p></p>

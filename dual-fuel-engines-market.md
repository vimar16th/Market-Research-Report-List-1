<p><strong>The Dual-Fuel Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Four-Stroke Dual-Fuel Engines</li><li>Two-Stroke Dual-Fuel Engines</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dual-fuel engines are a type of internal combustion engines that can operate on a combination of two different fuels. There are two main types: Four-stroke dual-fuel engines and Two-stroke dual-fuel engines. </p><p>Four-stroke dual-fuel engines follow a four-step cycle (intake, compression, power, and exhaust) and use a mixture of diesel and natural gas or LPG as fuel. These engines offer improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions compared to traditional diesel engines.</p><p>On the other hand, Two-stroke dual-fuel engines complete the same four steps in just two strokes of the piston. They also use a combination of diesel and natural gas or LPG but provide a simpler and more compact design, making them suitable for marine and specialized applications.</p><p>Both types of dual-fuel engines play a vital role in promoting cleaner and more sustainable energy sources in various industries.</p></p>

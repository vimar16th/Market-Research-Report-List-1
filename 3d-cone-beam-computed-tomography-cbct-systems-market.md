<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Image Intensifier Systems</li><li>Flat-Panel Imager Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>3D Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) Systems are medical imaging devices used to capture detailed images of a patient's anatomy. The two main types of CBCT systems are Image Intensifier Systems and Flat-Panel Imager Systems. Image Intensifier Systems use a camera-like device to amplify the X-ray signal before it is detected, providing better image quality. Conversely, Flat-Panel Imager Systems use a flat panel detector to capture X-rays directly, resulting in higher efficiency and reduced radiation exposure. Both systems play a vital role in diagnosing and planning treatments in medical and dental fields.</p></p>

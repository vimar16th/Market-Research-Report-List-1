<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminium Brazing Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Paste</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminium brazing flux is available in two different forms - powder and paste. Powder flux is a fine and dry substance, often used for torch brazing or when heating the brazed joint reaches high temperatures. It is commonly mixed with water to form a paste-like consistency for easier application. On the other hand, paste flux already has water added to it, making it ready to use directly. It is usually used for lower-temperature applications such as furnace brazing or when a liquid form of flux is desired for better control and convenience.</p></p>

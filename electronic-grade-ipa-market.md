<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Grade IPA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Purity, 99.99%</li><li>Purity, <99.99%</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electronic Grade IPA market consists of two main types based on purity levels. The first type is defined as IPA with a purity of 99.99%. This means that out of every 100 parts of the solution, 99.99 parts are composed of IPA, and the remaining 0.01 parts may contain impurities. The second type represents IPA with a purity level below 99.99%. In this case, the solution contains less than 99.99 parts of IPA out of every 100 parts, making it less pure and potentially containing higher impurity levels.</p></p>

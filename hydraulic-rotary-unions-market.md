<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Rotary Unions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Passage</li><li>Single-Passage</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydraulic rotary unions are devices used to transfer fluids from a stationary source to a rotating machine or vice versa. In the market, there are two types of hydraulic rotary unions: multi-passage and single-passage. Multi-passage rotary unions have multiple channels to transfer different fluid media simultaneously, allowing for efficient and compact designs. On the other hand, single-passage rotary unions only have one channel to transfer a single fluid medium. This type is commonly used when only one fluid needs to be transferred between the stationary and rotating parts.</p></p>

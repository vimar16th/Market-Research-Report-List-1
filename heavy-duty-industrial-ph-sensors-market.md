<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Duty Industrial pH Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glass Sensor</li><li>ISFET Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty industrial pH sensor market consists of two main types: glass sensors and ISFET sensors. Glass sensors use a pH-sensitive glass membrane to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a substance. ISFET sensors, on the other hand, use a silicon-based ion-sensitive field-effect transistor to measure pH levels. Both types of sensors are commonly used in industrial settings to ensure precise and reliable pH measurements, but they differ in their technology and application.</p></p>

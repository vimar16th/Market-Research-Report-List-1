<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Camshaft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Camshaft</li><li>Assembled Camshaft</li><li>Forged Camshaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle camshaft market is divided into three types: cast camshaft, assembled camshaft, and forged camshaft. A cast camshaft is made by pouring molten metal into a mold and is commonly used due to its cost-effectiveness. Assembled camshafts are created by joining different components like lobes, journals, and gears. These camshafts offer more customization options but are relatively expensive. On the other hand, forged camshafts are manufactured by heating and shaping solid metal, making them stronger and more durable, but also pricier than the other two types.</p></p>

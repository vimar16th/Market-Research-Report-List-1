<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Heart Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aorta</li><li>Mitral</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Structural Heart Device Market primarily involves two types of devices: Aorta and Mitral. Aorta devices are designed to treat conditions affecting the aortic valve, including aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation. These devices are implanted via minimally invasive procedures and help improve valve function. Mitral devices, on the other hand, focus on treating conditions affecting the mitral valve, such as mitral regurgitation. They aim to restore the normal flow of blood through the heart by repairing or replacing the malfunctioning valve. Both types of devices play a crucial role in addressing structural heart conditions.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant PP Granules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Free Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flame retardant polypropylene (PP) granules market is categorized into two types: halogen type and halogen-free type. </p><p>Halogen type flame retardant PP granules contain substances such as bromine or chlorine, which release gases when exposed to fire, thereby inhibiting the combustion process. While effective in reducing flammability, these halogens can pose environmental risks due to their toxic nature.</p><p>In contrast, halogen-free type flame retardant PP granules use non-halogenated compounds, such as phosphorus or nitrogen derivatives, to achieve a flame-retardant effect. This type is considered more environmentally friendly and does not emit toxic gases during combustion.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Front Windscreen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Front windscreen market types include laminated glass and tempered glass. Laminated glass is constructed by sandwiching a layer of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) between two layers of glass, providing safety benefits such as shatter resistance and UV protection. It is commonly used in automotive windshields. On the other hand, tempered glass is made by heating and cooling the glass in a controlled manner, increasing its strength and making it resistant to breakage. Tempered glass is commonly found in side and rear windows. Both types serve different purposes and cater to specific safety requirements in the automotive industry.</p></p>

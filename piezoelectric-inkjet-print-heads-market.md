<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piezoelectric Inkjet Print-heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Inkjet</li><li>Random Inkjet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piezoelectric inkjet print-heads are devices used in inkjet printers to deliver ink onto a surface. There are two main market types for these print-heads: continuous inkjet and random inkjet. Continuous inkjet systems produce a continuous stream of ink droplets, with unwanted droplets being diverted and recycled. Random inkjet systems eject ink droplets randomly, creating high-resolution images. Both market types offer precise control over ink placement, but continuous inkjet is commonly used for high-speed, industrial printing, while random inkjet is preferred for applications requiring fine details and image quality.</p></p>

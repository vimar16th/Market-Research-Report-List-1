<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Charger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-board Charger</li><li>Off-board Charger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric vehicle charger market consists of two primary types: on-board charger and off-board charger. An on-board charger is installed directly into the electric vehicle and is responsible for converting AC power from an external source into DC power to charge the vehicle's battery. On the other hand, an off-board charger is a separate device that is not integrated into the vehicle. It is used to charge the electric vehicle's battery by supplying DC power from an external source, which is then transferred to the vehicle's on-board charger.</p></p>

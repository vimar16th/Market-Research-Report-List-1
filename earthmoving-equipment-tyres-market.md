<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Earthmoving Equipment Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyres</li><li>Bias Tyres</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Earthmoving equipment tyres are available in two types: radial tyres and bias tyres. Radial tyres are constructed with the ply cords running radially from bead to bead, offering better traction, fuel efficiency, and longer tread life. They provide better stability and durability, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, bias tyres are built with multiple layers of ply cord crisscrossed at various angles, resulting in a stiffer sidewall. They offer better steering response and are more resistant to cuts and punctures, making them ideal for off-road and rugged conditions.</p></p>

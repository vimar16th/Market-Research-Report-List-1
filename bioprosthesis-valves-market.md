<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioprosthesis Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porcine Tissue</li><li>Bovine Tissue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioprosthesis valves refer to artificial heart valves made from animal tissue. There are two main types: porcine tissue valves and bovine tissue valves. Porcine tissue valves are made from pig heart tissue, which is treated and transformed into a valve. Bovine tissue valves, on the other hand, are made from cow heart tissue. Both types serve the same purpose of replacing damaged or diseased heart valves in humans. These valves are commonly used in surgical procedures due to their durability and compatibility with the human body.</p></p>

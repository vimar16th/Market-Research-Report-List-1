<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infant Nasal CPAP Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HFNC</li><li>Mechanical</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Infant Nasal CPAP market includes two main types - High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) and Mechanical CPAP. HFNC delivers a higher flow of warm, humidified oxygen to infants' nasal passages, assisting with breathing and improving oxygen levels. It is mainly used for infants with mild to moderate respiratory distress. Mechanical CPAP, on the other hand, uses a machine to deliver a constant positive pressure to keep the airways open during inhalation and exhalation. It is commonly employed for infants with more severe respiratory issues. Both types aim to provide effective respiratory support for infants.</p></p>

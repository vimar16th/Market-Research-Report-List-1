<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-Based Intumescent Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Fiber</li><li>Natural Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Water-based intumescent coatings are used as fire retardant coatings on various surfaces such as steel structures and wood. There are two types of water-based intumescent coatings on the market: polymer fiber and natural fiber. Polymer fiber-based coatings are made using synthetic fibers that are highly resistant to heat and fire. These coatings provide excellent fire protection by expanding into a thick, insulating foam when exposed to high temperatures. On the other hand, natural fiber-based coatings are made from organic materials like cellulose fibers. These coatings also expand when exposed to heat, creating a protective and insulating barrier against flames and heat.</p></p>

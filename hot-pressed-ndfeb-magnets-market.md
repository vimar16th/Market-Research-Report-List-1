<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hot-pressed NdFeB Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isotropic</li><li>Anisotropic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hot-pressed NdFeB magnets are categorized into isotropic and anisotropic types based on their magnetic properties. Isotropic magnets have random magnetic orientations, which means their magnetic properties are equally strong in all directions. On the other hand, anisotropic magnets have a preferred direction of magnetization, resulting in stronger and more concentrated magnetic properties along a specific axis. The market for isotropic magnets is suitable for applications where a uniform magnetic field is required, while anisotropic magnets are preferred when a stronger and more directed magnetic field is needed.</p></p>

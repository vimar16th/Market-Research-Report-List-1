<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Motor Bonded Cores Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Rolled Non-Oriented (CRNO)</li><li>CRGO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Motor Bonded Cores market consists of two main types of cores: Cold Rolled Non-Oriented (CRNO) and Cold Rolled Grain-Oriented (CRGO) cores. CRNO cores are made from steel sheets that have been cold-rolled and have a non-uniform crystal structure, which helps reduce energy loss in the core. On the other hand, CRGO cores are made from steel sheets that have been cold-rolled in a way that aligns the crystal structure, resulting in improved magnetic properties. Both types of cores are commonly used in automotive motors for their energy efficiency and magnetic performance.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Central Air-conditioning Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vapor Compression Refrigeration</li><li>Absorption Refrigeration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Central air-conditioning refers to a system that provides cooling and dehumidification to an entire building through a centralized unit. Two common market types within central air-conditioning are vapor compression refrigeration and absorption refrigeration. Vapor compression refrigeration utilizes a compressor to circulate and compress a refrigerant, extracting heat from the air and cooling it. Absorption refrigeration, on the other hand, uses heat to drive a chemical reaction that results in cooling. Both types offer efficient cooling solutions for large spaces, but differ in the mechanisms used for heat removal and cooling.</p></p>
